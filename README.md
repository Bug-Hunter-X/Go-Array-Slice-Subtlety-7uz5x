# Go Array Slice Subtlety
This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked subtlety in Go related to arrays and slices.  The example code showcases how modifications to a slice can unexpectedly alter the original array, highlighting the importance of understanding memory management in Go.

## The Issue
Go slices are dynamic views of underlying arrays.  Modifying a slice can directly impact the original array if they share the same underlying data. This code illustrates this behavior where changing the first element of the slice `b` also alters the original array `a` because they reference the same memory region. 

## Solution
The solution provides a method to create a deep copy of the array to avoid unintended modifications. This guarantees that changes made to a slice do not affect the original array, preserving data integrity.
